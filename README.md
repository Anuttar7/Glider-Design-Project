# Glider-Design-Project
AE244: Low Speed Aerodynamics (Course Project) <br/>
Ansys 2-D CFD Fluent simulations were used to obtain an desirable airfoil subject to certain airspeed at standard atmospheric conditions.<br/>
Python program was coded from scratch to obtain results with same accuracy as that of Ansys simulations but faster and at cheaper computational costs.<br/>
Designed a functioning Glider using OpenVSP software capable of gliding 30km from an altitude of 1km while carrying an 80kg man.<br/>
